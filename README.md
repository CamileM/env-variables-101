# Environmental Variables in BASH:

THIS LESSON FOCUSES ON ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

## WHAT IS A VARIABLE?
A Variable is a name that can be used to extract from a code. Variables are like boxes
where you can put and take things from it.

For us an Environment is a system where code runs for different purposes. Commonly known
there are 3 Environments that exist:
- Developing
- Testing
- Production

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
They exist inside the environment(Machine) and  they are interpolated from the
environment and NOT from the code.

This Is Great For Things:
- Things that you don't to have in your code.
    - like access key
    - like AWS_SECRET keys
    - like SHH keys

THEY NEVER GO IN THE CODE!
